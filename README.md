Data 
1.	Pick a Data Source of your choice 
2.	Optional: Netflix shows: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows/data 
Objectives 
1.	Create a responsive dashboard accessible from both a desktop/mobile device that displays the data. Examples: 
1.	Table of data with search, filter, sorting, and pagination 
2.	Graphs to help guide the user to a conclusion about the data 
2.	Use Angular for the front-end 
3.	Use Flask/FastAPI Python for any back-end code if necessary 
4.	Push data into a database of your choice 
5.	Unit Testing, Linting implemented 
6.	Check in the code to your personal GitHub account. 
Extra Points 
1.	Push data into a database of your choice 
2.	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment features set up (CI/CD) 
3.	 E.g. CircleCI, Travis, GCP Cloud Build, Github Actions, etc. 
1.	Authentication implemented so that only authenticated users are capable of accessing the dashboard. 
2.	Deploy the application in Google Cloud (Use free tier with new account setup) 

Preferably you can use managed services (App Engine, Cloud Run, CloudSQL, etc.) 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
